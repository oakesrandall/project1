Project Proposal:

I intend to create a web version of the classic Simon game.  

From Wikipedia: Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, with software programming by Lenny Cope, The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the series. If the user succeeds the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over.

To accomplish this, I will use HTML, CSS, and LOTS of JavaScript.

In addition to tracking the user's repetition of the computer generated sequence, I intend to collect the user's longest streak and how many attempts have been made.

As the ad goes: "Simon's a computer, Simon has a brain, you either do what Simon says or else go down the drain"
