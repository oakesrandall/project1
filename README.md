Project Proposal:

I intend to create a web version of the classic Simon game.  

From Wikipedia: Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, with software programming by Lenny Cope, The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the series. If the user succeeds the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over.

To accomplish this, I will use HTML, CSS, and LOTS of JavaScript.

I will be generating a random series of flashing colors in a grid of four colored boxes.  After the computer flashes a pattern, the user will have to recreate that pattern.  If the pattern is correct, the computer speeds up and the player takes another shot at repeating it.  This goes on until the player fails, or the player reaches 20 successful events.  In addition to tracking the user's repetition of the computer generated sequence, I intend to collect the user's longest streak and how many attempts have been made.

As the ad goes: "Simon's a computer, Simon has a brain, you either do what Simon says or else go down the drain"

Stretch Goals: 

I'd like to have the game board area look like the old Simon game.  If I have time, I'll make that happen.

I think this particular game would play really well on mobile, so I'm planning on making it responsive, assuming I have time.
