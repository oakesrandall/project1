Project 1.

Proposal 1:

I want to create a game similar to the typing challenges of yore, with a few changes.

The game will pit two players against each other, answering challenges in the the shortest amount of time possible. The game will switch between the players upon correct answer submissions, and the game will end after each player has completed a predetermined number of rather simple challenges. The player with the lower score, in this case, the total amount of time elapsed during their turns, is the winner.

An alternate game style would include the same challenges, but in this instance, the timer counts down to zero. The player who's turn it is when time runs out is the loser. A sort of digital Hot Potato, if you will.
